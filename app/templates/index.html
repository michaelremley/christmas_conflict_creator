  <h2 style="color: #007b66;">The Problem</h2>
  Have you ever had trouble enjoying your holiday family dinner due to the wrong amount of conflict? Maybe the people in agreement with each other sat near each other, and their conversations just turned into echo chambers. Or maybe people with differing opinions were mixed in with each other, and there was too much conflict, leading to several broken dishes.
  <h2 style="color: #007b66;">Our Solution</h2>
  <p>
    Every member of your family will fill out a Google Forms survey with important questions that might cause conflict, such as, “Should pineapple go on pizza?”, and “Is this survey a waste of time?”. The answers to this survey can then be downloaded as a .csv file. Once you have this .csv file, our proprietary* algorithm will take in that data and make a graph out of it, with vertices representing each person. The edges between each person represent if they agree on questions. Next, the algorithm will use clique finding to find the biggest “cliques'' in the graph, ie. clusters of people who agree with each other. Then, depending on whether you selected to maximize or minimize conflict, it will output a seating plan in which cliques are either seated next to each other, or split up as much as possible. This will create the optimal amount of conflict at your family holiday dinner.
  </p>
  <p>
    The algorithm works by placing someone in each seat who has the fewest cliques in common with the person across and people beside that seat. So, when it knows a seat and its neighbors, each unseated person will receive a total score of maximal cliques not in common with the neighbors.

  <h2 style="color: #007b66;">Background Information</h2>
  <h3 style="color: #bd1320;">Clique finding</h3>
  <p>
    Cliques are subsets of undirected graphs such that every two vertices in a clique have an edge connecting them. There are many algorithms that exist to help in finding cliques within a graph. Some that have been discovered specify specific cliques a person may want to find such as finding maximal cliques (single or all), cliques of fixed size, and the maximum/largest clique.
  </p>
  <h3 style="color: #bd1320;">Types of Cliques</h3>
  <image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Maximal.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />

  <strong>Maximal Cliques:</strong>
  <p>
    The maximal clique for a person is the largest set of people who all agree with that person on a certain topic. In graph theory, this is the largest set of nodes that are all connected to each other and includes the node representing the person.   </p>

  <strong>Maximum Clique:</strong>
  <p>
    The maximum clique is the largest clique possible in the graph. The largest clique in the graph above is made by (Santa, Snowman, Mrs. Claus, and Penguin) because each person is connected to the other 3.
  </p>
  <strong>Fixed Size Cliques:</strong>
  <p>
    Any clique that exists in a graph. For example, (Santa, Rudolph, and Snowman) all agree on something and form a clique of 3, but smaller cliques of 2 also form (Santa, Rudolph), (Santa, Snowman), and (Rudolph, Snowman).
  </p>
  <h3 style="color: #bd1320;">Existing Algorithms</h3>
  <strong>Greedy Algorithm:</strong>
  <p>
    The greedy algorithm is a type of algorithm that is designed to make the best choice during each step.
    They are often used to find a single maximal clique of a graph. The way it does so is first by selecting a single random vertex. Then each subsequent vertex added to the clique is determined on a case by case basis. In the case of looking for a single maximal clique, each vertex added after the first one is based on the requirement that each vertex in the clique must have an edge connecting them to all of the other vertices.

  </p>
  <strong>Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm:</strong>
  <p>
    The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is an algorithm that looks for all maximal cliques in a graph. This is a recursive algorithm. The algorithm works with a partial, unfinished clique, a set of possible vertices that can be added to make a maximal clique, then a set of vertices that cannot be added to the clique as it would produce a solution that has already been found. First it recursively tries out adding each of the candidate vertices. Once all candidate vertices have been tested, then the forbidden vertices will be tested.  </p>
  <strong>Brute Force Algorithm:</strong>
  <p>
    A brute force algorithm is an algorithm that determines all possible candidates to be a solution. In the case of clique-finding, it would give all possible subgraphs. Then, each of the candidates will be checked to see if they satisfy the solution requirements. This methodology is simple to implement, however it has a high cost and the larger the problem, the more the errors. As a result,the brute force method is used for smaller problems.
    This algorithm can be used to find cliques of fixed size.

  <h2 style="color: #007b66;">How it works</h2>
  <h3 style="color: #bd1320;">Survey to Graph</h3>
  <p>
    A branch and bound algorithm is an approach that enumerates all candidates for being a solution. The candidates form a rooted tree and the algorithm explores the different candidates. If a solution is found that produces a better solution, then a new branch is added and vertex represents said solution. This methodology is efficient when it comes to finding a solution, but the tradeoff is its speed. There have been studies applying this algorithm methodology while also trying to improve the time it takes to determine the solution, as shown in Östergård’s 2002 paper which aimed to use the branch and bound algorithm to find the maximum clique in a graph.  </p>
  <p>
    This code file uses the software <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> to put the data from the .csv file into a data frame, which makes it easier to manipulate to form the graph. We also use <a href="https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html">Networkx</a> in order to create the graph.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code first imports the csv file using the Pandas function read_csv, which makes Pandas turn the csv into a data frame. Once the data is in a data frame, it needs to be slightly cleaned up. The code deletes the timestamp column and also converts the “Name” column to the row names, leaving us with a data frame with the names as rows and questions as columns.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once we have the data in the right shape, the code will call a function which initializes the graph, which makes an empty graph using the Networkx library, then adds a vertex for each person. Once the graph has been initialized, the final function build_graph goes through all of the questions and answers, and adds an edge between 2 vertices if the people agree about the question answered.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #bd1320;">Graph to Seating Arrangement</h3>
  <p>We used the Python libraries Networkx, Matplotlib, and Numpy to do the mathematics of this project. Networkx comes with many algorithms built in, including clique finding and graph coloring.</p>

<p>Once the user’s .csv file is turned into an agreement graph by the process in the last section, the algorithm checks if the user has asked for a chaotic arrangement or a peaceful arrangement. If the user has asked for a chaotic arrangement, no changes to the agreement graph are necessary. However, if the user has asked for a peaceful arrangement, the complement of the graph is used, where every disagreement is an edge and people who agree on issues are not connected. With the agreement graph, we find and list all cliques for each person so that we can refer to them later.</p>
<p>For a theoretical quiz result where three animals agree, Mrs. and Mr. Claus agree, and a snowman agrees with nobody, we get the following agreement graph.
<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Agreement.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />
<p>In this example, there are 5 cliques: a clique of the 3 animals, a clique for each pair of animals, and a clique with Mrs. and Mr. Claus.</p>
<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Cliques.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />
	<p>Next, we need a graph describing the seating arrangement. This is assumed to be a long table where the odd-numbered person is sat on the end as they probably would in real life. Every seat is connected to its side neighbor(s) and the person across from them, since these are the people with whom they speak and disagree.</p>

<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'EmptyTable.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />

<p>Starting with seat #1, we move clockwise. This choice is random because there are not yet neighbors to check cliques against. In this case, it is the abominable snowman who gets this seat.
<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Table1.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />

<p>For the next seat #2, we count how many cliques each other character has with the abominable snowman, then they lose 1 point for each clique. The Reindeer and Penguin are both in the clique of 3 and in a clique of 2 with the abominable snowman, so they both have a score of -2. The other characters lose no points because they are in no cliques with the abominable snowman. The regular snowman has a highest score, so he gets sat in chair #2.</p>
<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Table2.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />

<p>For seat #3, nobody is in a clique with the regular snowman, so everyone has a score of zero. We will say that Santa is randomly selected for seat #3.</p>
<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Table3.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />

<p>For seat #4, Mrs. Claus is in a clique with Santa, so her score goes down. The reindeer is randomly selected from the two 0's for seat #4.</p>
<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Table4.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />

<p>For seat #5, neither Mrs. Claus or the penguin are in cliques with the snowman, so no scores change. The penguin is in a clique with the reindeer, so their score is -1. Mrs. Claus gets to be in seat #5 with a high score of zero.</p>
<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Table5.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />

<p>The penguin gets the final seat with a score of -1 because there are no other options.</p>
<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Table6.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />

<p>In this final arrangement, Mr. and Mrs. Claus were split up, and one of the animals was separated from their clique. This is not an optimal solution, since the following seating arrangement would break apart all cliques.</p>
<image src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'Optimal.png')}} " class="img-responsive" />

<p>In summary, we seat everyone by moving around the table clockwise to assign someone to each seat. The algorithm decides who should sit in a given seat by considering everyone who has not been seated yet. The person who is in the fewest and smallest cliques with the neighbors of this seat will be seated here. For each person, not only does their maximal clique count against them but so does every agreement with other people in the clique. This way, the largest cliques are most likely to be broken apart. If the goal is a peaceful arrangement, the person who has the most total cliques in common with the neighbors is assigned instead. This is repeated until everyone has been assigned to a seat.
With the final seating arrangement, we generate an image of the table and display it so you know how to arrange your dinner table for the holidays!</p>
